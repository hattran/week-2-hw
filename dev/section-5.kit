                <p>Gone are the days of plain and unexciting home décor. It’s a new era in home design, filled with
                    vibrant and bold colors and patterns. An option is to use color sparingly. For example, pick one
                    main color and figure out ways to make it pop around the room. This way, your accents can be subtler
                    and work to compliment to the main hue. Bold furniture is the best way to execute a simple but
                    striking look and balance out the room.</p>
